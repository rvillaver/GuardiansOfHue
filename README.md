Setup:
1.	Set the Location [6] card (also referred to the center card) dark side up on the play area. The rest of the card's, shuffle and play light side up one at a time. When playing cards, its side must be placed orthogonally in any orientation as long as, it’s either flush to the center card, or it is adjacent to at least two other cards. Sample setup for 2 player game shown below:
 
2.	Darkness Grows
a.	Roll the Black Die and choose any Location applicable for the value rolled. Turn that location to its dark side.  That location is now sealed in darkness. If all locations of that value are already sealed, spawn an Agent of Sepia (Black Meeple) on that location. The locations with the tag [3] are applicable for roll values 1, 2 and 3.
b.	Only during setup, repeat Darkness Grows step again, as much as the number of players. Each player chooses a meeple of their choice (Red, Blue, Green or Yellow). Starting player is the one with the most colorful outfit. 
3.	For 3 to 4 players put an Agent of Sepia on the Center location during setup.
Game Steps:
1.	Player Actions
•	Players in turn order can do 4 actions in any combination:
•	Move: The current player can move their meeple to any adjacent location. Locations are adjacent if they share a side.
•	Attack: The current player can attack an Agent of Sepia in location they are in. The enemy agent’s strength is equal to the         Agent Strength Rating on the card. The player rolls 3 white dice in an attempt to equal or exceed the target value. Target value is the Strength Rating multiplied by 3. If a player fails this attempt, exhaust their Meeple by laying it on its side. If a player defeats an enemy agent, the agent is sent back to the center location exhausted. Attacking an agent at a location on its light side has a target value of 0, so there is no need to roll, but it still uses up an action.
Example: Attacking an agent at Location [6] has a Strength Rating of 5. The target value becomes 15. Players must roll 3 dice totaling a value that equals or exceeds 15.
•	Encounter: If a location has no Agents of Sepia, a player may attempt an encounter at the location they are in. Target value is the total          Encounter Influence rating on the card plus all other Encounter Influence ratings on adjacent cards, then multiplied by 3. If a player succeeds in defeating the encounter, put a White Guardian Meeple Spirit on that location.
Resolution is similar to Attack. When an agent fails the attempt, they are also exhausted. Example: A location has an influence of 2, beside it is an influence of 1. Means total rating is 3; the target value is 9.
Total Encounter Influence	Enemy Encountered
1-6	Contrast Shadows
7-9	Pica Savage
10-14	Ins Tangram Spirit
15-18	VS Commander

•	Break Seal: If a location has No Agents of Sepia and has a White Guardian Meeple Spirit, a player may attempt to break the seal of darkness. The target value is the location’s         Defense Rating multiplied by 3. If a player succeeds, flip location on to light side. Players can only attempt to break the seal of the center location if all other locations are on their light side.
•	Stand: Players whose meeple are exhausted can not do any other action except to stand. Put their meeple upright. They can stand multiple times, as long as they still have an action for it.
•	Assist: A player can use an action to stand another player’s meeple as long as they are on the same location.
•	Support (Off Turn): This is a free action of non-active players, during a player’s turn, who are on the same location with that active player. Exhaust their Meeple to reduce any rating by 1. For example: A player is attempting an encounter with the rating of 7, and two of their peers are on the same location. The peers can both exhaust their Meeples to reduce the rating for a sum of 2. The rating is now 5 which will have a target value of 15.
Instead of reducing, another free action is to exhaust their meeple to reroll any number of dice before applying the result for the active player.
2.	Agents of Sepia Actions
•	For each agent standing, that agent moves to an adjacent location that’s on its light side priority having the highest location tag / number. If there are multiple options, players decide which to move to. Active agents must move to a new location. The starting player for this round rolls the black dice 1D6. If the roll exceeds or equals the location tag value, agent wins and puts that location to its dark side. Nothing happens if the agent fails its attempt.
•	After each active agent has taken their action, stand each exhausted agent.
3.	Darkness Grows
•	Do the Darkness Grows step like the setup but only once for Easy. Twice for Difficult, and Thrice for Impossible.
4.	Upkeep
•	Check for the win condition, if all cards are on one side, the game immediately ends otherwise, the next player to the left is the new starting player, and a new round begins.
Variants
5th Player Variant.
The 5th player is Lord Sepia. He controls all the agents. Any decision or action to be taken must be decided by the Lord Sepia Player. He wins if all locations are on the dark side, and he loses if all locations are on the light side.
